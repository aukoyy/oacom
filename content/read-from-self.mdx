### Code used in this example
<ExternalLink href="https://github.com/aukoyy/gha-example-self">gha-example-self repository</ExternalLink>
<br />
<ExternalLink href="https://github.com/aukoyy/gha-example-infra">gha-example-infra repository</ExternalLink>

Feel free to copy the full workflow and test it out yourself! You can trigger the workflow from the Actions tab in GitHub, and you should see it dispatch the workflow in `gha-example-infra` successfully.

## Bonus: read files from the self service repo
